Now you have a local repository, created in excersize 2, we can now create a new remote repository ready to push it!

**Steps to Create the Private Repository:**

1.  **Navigate to the "New Repository" Page:**
    *   In your GitHub account, look for a "+" icon in the top-right corner of the screen. Click on it.
    *   From the dropdown menu, select "New repository".  This will take you to a form where you can define your new repository.

2.  **Fill in the Repository Details:**
    *   **Repository Name:** Enter the name `my_first_repository` to match the local repository created in the previous excersize.
    *   **Description (Optional):** You can add a short description to explain the purpose of your repository. This isn't required for this excersize.
    *   **Visibility:**  **Select "Private".** This ensures that only you (and anyone you explicitly grant access to) can see the repository's contents.
    *   **Initialize this repository with a README:**  Ensure this is this unchecked. 
    *   **Add .gitignore:** Select **None**
    *   **Choose a license:** Select **None**
    *   Once you're satisfied with the details, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the green "Create repository" button.

**That's it! You have now created a new, empty, private repository on GitHub.**

**Important Notes:**

*   **Private vs. Public:**  Understand the difference! A *public* repository is visible to everyone on GitHub, while a *private* repository is only accessible to you and those you explicitly grant access.
