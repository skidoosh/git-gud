**1. Prerequisites: Installing Homebrew (If You Don't Already Have It)**

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS. If you don't have it installed, follow these steps:

*   **Open Terminal:** The default terminal, or iTerm2 are fine.
*   **Paste and Run the Installation Command:** Copy and paste this command into your terminal window, then press Enter:

    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

*   **Follow the On-Screen Instructions:** The script will likely ask for your administrator password.
*   **Post-Installation Instructions:** After the installation completes, Homebrew will likely provide some post-installation instructions.  **Please follow these instructions!** They usually involve adding Homebrew's bin directory to your `PATH` environment variable.  This allows you to run Homebrew commands from anywhere in the terminal and most software packages you install using the tool

**Important:** If you're using a different shell (like `zsh`), the instructions might be slightly different. Homebrew will tell you what to do in your specific case.

**2. Installing Git**

Once Homebrew is installed and configured, install Git using the following command and press enter:

    ```bash
    brew install git
    ```

Homebrew will now download and install Git and any necessary dependencies.  

**3. Installing OpenSSH**

Now we have Git installed, we need to install OpenSSH. We use OpenSSH to authenticate to remote servers, create key pairs and signing commits. To install OpenSSH use the following commend and hit enter:

    ```bash
    brew install openssh
    ```

**Notice:** OpenSSH may have already been installed with Git, or may already be installed as part of macOS. Please install the package via Homebrew anyway so we're all using the same version.

**4. Verification: Checking Installations**

*   **Verify your Git Installation:**

    * To confirm Git is installed and ready to use, input the following command and hit enter:

      ```bash
      git --version
      ```

    *   You should see the Git version number printed to the Terminal (e.g., `git version 2.50.0`).

*   **Verify OpenSSH Installation:**
    *   To confirm OpenSSH has been installed correctly, type the following command and hit enter:

        ```bash
        ssh -V
        ```

    *   You should see the OpenSSH version number printed to the terminal (e.g., `OpenSSH_9.9p2, LibreSSL 3.3.6`).
