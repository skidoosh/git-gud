**What is GitHub?**

Before getting started, I'll explain what GitHub is. It's a web-based platform that provides Git, a version control system as a service. GitHub's primamy use cases are:

*   **A place to store your code:** Like a cloud-based hard drive specifically for software projects.
*   **A collaboration tool:**  Allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously, tracking changes and merging them together.
*   **An enterprise version control system:**  In addition to personal, and Free and Open Source Projects. GitHub can also be utilised by enterprise to act at their organisations remote version control system. 

**Step 1: Go to the GitHub Website**

*   Open your web browser
*   Go to the GitHub website: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)

**Step 2: Sign Up for an Account**

*   In the top right of the window, you'll see a "Sign up" button. Click that.
*   **Choose a username:** GitHub will ask you to choose a username. This will be your username for all projects and organisations. Choose wisely.
    *   **Choose wisely:**  Consider using a professional-sounding username, and avoid Kung-Fu Panda references where possible.
*   **Email Address:** Enter a valid email address that you check regularly. GitHub will send verification emails and important notifications to this address. GitHub will also provide you with a privacy preserving, no-reply email address also if configured (and you will).
*   **Password:** Create a strong, unique password. Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The longer, the better. Don't reuse passwords you use on other websites.  Consider using a password manager to generate and store strong passwords securely.
*   **Optional: Name & Organization (Skip for Now)** Not required for this course.
*   **Terms of Service & Privacy Policy:** Read the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy...
*   **Click "Create account"**: This will submit your registration information.

**Step 3: Email Verification**

*   **Check your inbox:** Open your inbox and open the email from GitHub.
*   **Click the verification link:** The email will contain a link. Click this link to verify your email address and complete the account creation process.

**Step 4: Account Setup (Optional, but Recommended)**

*   **Choose a plan:**  Select the **free plan** ans skip everything else for now. 

**Security Considerations:**

*   **Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA):**  This adds an extra layer of security to your account. GitHub strongly recommends enabling MFA. You can find this option in your account settings (Security section).
*   **Use a Strong, unique password:** As mentioned earlier, use a strong and unique password. If possible, use a password manager like [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/)!
